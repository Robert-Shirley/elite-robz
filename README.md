Hello everyone. Relatively new developer here, this is my personal page. Currently doing the Odin Project, so I would recommend checking that out!


Here's a few projects you can check out

Cover Letter Generator - Built with react, you can enter information and generate a cover letter. It's easy to switch between the edit and preview mode. I also included a print button. It was also built with some material ui themes

Created with Firebase/Firestore. It also has User Auth.
