Hello everyone. Relatively new developer here, this is my personal page. Currently doing the Odin Project, so I would recommend checking that out!


Here's a few projects you can check out

A 'Finance Tracker' made with D3.js. It uses firebase as a backend. This is currently set to any user can alter the data, so i might need to tinker with the permissions. Since I don't want to make my api keys public, I don't think that anyone can access the database if I host on github pages, so I will likely have to build this out with Firebase and host there

Functioning To-Do List (I still wanna refine this and improve it even more)
Created with Firebase/Firestore. It also has User Auth.
